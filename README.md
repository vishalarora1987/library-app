# library-app
Assignment


What this app does - 

Problem
Implement a GUI that takes a book title input by the user, searches for matches using the Open Library API (see below), and displays the results to the user.

Open Library
https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/search


How to run the app -

1. Go to your git directory and clone the app using 
git clone https://github.com/vishalarora1987/library-app.git

2. cd into library-app and you would be on master branch using
cd library-app

3. Next, install the application using (assuming you have required libraries installed)
npm install

4. We will use Expo to run the application on our devices. Please refer this link (or use npm install -g expo-cli command for installing expo cli) for installation https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/ and run following command

expo start

This command will start the server and open http://localhost:19002/ where you will see a QR code. Scan the QR code using your expo app on android or camera on iOS.

Once scanned, expo will create the build and run the application on your device.

5. Start searching the Books Catalogue for your favourite book

Cheers!!!
